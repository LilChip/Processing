# Processing
My code based on the software and environment of processing.org

A few years ago I had a hankering to draw some images with a computer.
Most of the software programming languages and environments I investigated had a steep learning curve.
Then I discovered Processing through Daniel Shiffman's YouTube videos.  One episode and I was hooked.
I've had a tremendous amoumt of fun experimenting with the code.  
I am posting these files in the hopes that soemone else finds them fun, also.

I am the first to admit that I code for clarity, not density.  
I prefer to write two lines of code that I can understand in a year vs. one line of haiku-ish/delphic condensation.
So I am sure that there is better, cleaner code out there.  Please consider this code as a starting point for your explorations.

Best regards,

LilChip
